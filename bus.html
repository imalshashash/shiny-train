<h1><u>Bus Topology</u></h1>
<img src="image 7.jpeg" height="50%" width="50%" alt="logo">
<p><b>In case of Bus Topology,</b> all devices share single communication line or cable.Bus topology may have problem while multiple hosts sending data at the same 
      time. Therefore, Bus topology either uses CSMA/CD technology or recognizes one host as Bus Master to solve the issue. It is one of the simple forms of networking
      where a failure of a device does not affect the other devices. But failure of the shared communication line can make all other devices stop functioning. <br><br>
      Both ends of the shared channel have line terminator. The data is sent in only one direction and as soon as it reaches the extreme end, the terminator removes 
      the data from the line.</br></br></p>
