      <p>
        <b>A metropolitan area network</b>, or MAN, consists of a computer
        network across an entire city, college campus or small region. A MAN is
        larger than a LAN, which is typically limited to a single building or
        site. Depending on the configuration, this type of network can cover an
        area from several miles to tens of miles. A MAN is often used to connect
        several LANs together to form a bigger network. When this type of
        network is specifically designed for a college campus, it is sometimes
        referred to as a campus area network, or CAN.
