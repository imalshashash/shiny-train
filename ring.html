<h1><u>Ring Topology</u></h1>
<div class="col-6">
   <p><b>In ring topology</b>, each host machine connects to exactly two other machines, creating a circular network structure. When one host tries to communicate or send 
      message to a host which is not adjacent to it, the data travels through all intermediate hosts. To connect one more host in the existing structure, the administrator 
      may need only one more extra cable.<br><br> Failure of any host results in failure of the whole ring.Thus, every connection in the ring is a point of failure. There 
      are methods which employ one more backup ring.</br></br></p>
