<h1><u>Personal Area Network</u>(PAN)</h1>
<div class="col-9">
  <p><b>A personal area network</b>, or PAN, is a computer network organized around an individual person within a single building. This could be inside a small office or
    residence. A typical PAN would include one or more computers, telephones, peripheral devices, video game consoles and other personal entertainment devices.<br><br>If 
    multiple individuals use the same network within a residence, the network is sometimes referred to as a home area network, or HAN. In a very typical setup,
    a residence will have a single wired Internet connection connected to a modem. This modem then provides both wired and wireless connections for multiple devices.
    The network is typically managed from a single computer but can be accessed from any device.</br></br>This type of network provides great flexibility. For example, 
    it allows you to:
   <ol>
   <li>Send a document to the printer in the office upstairs while you are sitting on the couch with your laptop.</li>
   <li>Upload a photo from your cell phone to your desktop computer.</li>
   <li>Watch movies from an online streaming service to your TV.</li>
   </ol>
   <br>If this sounds familiar to you, you likely have a PAN in your house without having called it by its name.</br>
