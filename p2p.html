<h1><u>Point to point Topology</u></h1>
<div class="col-6">
  <p><b>Point-to-point </b> networks contains exactly two hosts such as computer, switches or routers, servers connected back to back using a single piece of cable. Often, 
    the receiving end of one host is connected to sending end of the other and vice-versa.<br><br>If the hosts are connected point-to-point logically, then may have multiple 
    intermediate devices. But the end hosts are unaware of underlying network and see each other as if they are connected directly.</br></br></p>
