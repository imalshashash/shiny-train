<h1><u>Star Topology</u></h1>
<div class="col-7">
  <p>All hosts in Star topology are connected to a central device, known as hub device, using a point-to-point connection. That is, there exists a point to point 
    connection between hosts and hub. The hub device can be any of the following:
  <ul>
  <li>Layer-1 device such as hub or repeater.</li>
  <li>Layer-2 device such as switch or bridge.</li>
  <li>Layer-3 device such as router or gateway.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  As in Bus topology, hub acts as single point of failure. If hub fails, connectivity of all hosts to all other hosts fails. Every communication between hosts, takes 
    place through only the hub.Star topology is not expensive as to connect one more host, only one cable is required and configuration is simple.</p>
