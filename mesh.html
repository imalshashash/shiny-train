<h1><u>Mesh Topology</u></h1>
<div class="col-8">
  <p>In this type of topology, a host is connected to one or multiple hosts.This topology has hosts in point-to-point connection with every other host or may also have 
    hosts which are in point-to-point connection to few hosts only.<br><br> Hosts in Mesh topology also work as relay for other hosts which do not have direct point-to-point
    links. Mesh technology comes into two types:</br>
   <ol>
   <li>Full Mesh: All hosts have a point-to-point connection to every other host in the network. Thus for every new host n(n-1)/2 connections are required. It provides 
    the most reliable network structure among all network topologies.</li><br>
   <li>Partially Mesh: Not all hosts have point-to-point connection to every other host. Hosts connect to each other in some arbitrarily fashion. This topology exists 
    where we need to provide reliability to some hosts out of all.</li>
   </ol>
